# metafilter-favisualised

Unofficial Metafilter web-extension.

An update of Jordan Reiter's [Metafilter MultiFavorited Multiwidth](http://userscripts-mirror.org/scripts/review/18788) Greasemonkey script to add a visual cue to post comments on Metafilter.

This version includes all the subsites that include comments, and not just Mefi, Ask, and Talk.
